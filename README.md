# Linguistic-Masticator
A machine to chew words
The Linguistic Masticator is a software device
which 'chews up the words' 
I say software, but in fact its teeth are very hard. 
It can snap any text into segments into sub-segs 
Sub-segs get smaller as the teeth 'chew' 
We soon end up with letters, not words. 
I can't more say anymore, 
because my words are all wchepud
